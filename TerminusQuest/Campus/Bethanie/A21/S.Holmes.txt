Hello, welcome to the Centre des Langues, let’s resolve a little
colundrum. Look at the paper behind me. There are tons of names but only one
corresponds to yours. Try to find it using the grep command. You can use it this
way : cat name_list | grep <something>. With that pipe (|), grep is using the
result of the command before the pipe. You can use the manual of grep to get
more information (man grep).
